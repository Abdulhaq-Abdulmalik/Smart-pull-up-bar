# Smart-pull-up-bar
A Smart Pull-Up Bar using a NODEMCU which, when you start doing Pull-Ups or Chin-Ups starts playing music in order to keep you motivated and after exercising for a certain period, a reward, a Tic Tac, in my instance gets dispensed.
Basically I've made a Laser beam sensor by attaching a cheap Laser Diode and an LDR on the Pull-Up Bar. They are perfectly aligned which means that a lot of light reaches the LDR and thus the sensor outputs a high analog value. However once I place my hands on the bar to start working out I block the light beam, the value gets significantly lower and the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino Nano, which is mounted on the wall in an enclosure and then a song starts playing using a small speaker (In my case it was Take on me by A-ha). After around 30 seconds, when the song ends, if I still have my hands on the bar, a reward, a Tic Tac gets dispensed using a 3D printed mechanism that's rotated by a servo!
